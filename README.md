# Nexco Portfolio

Hey there! I'm Anthony "Ant" Clark and this repo holds the code behind my personal corner of the web. It's not a starter template or a polished libraryâ€”just the playground where I experiment and share what I'm up to.

## What You'll Find

Most of the features began as weekend curiosities. The hero section cycles through my various roles, projects load dynamically with tabs and badges, and the contact form funnels messages through Formspree. I also keep a set of dev tools and a live stock ticker on the dashboard just because I can.

## Running Locally (If You Really Want To)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). It's mainly built for me, but you're welcome to poke around.

To build a production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm test
```
